    from:

        Global -> Actions -> Create

    where the action module is one of the notify option from this extension:

        "NotifyTwilio"
		"NotifySMSgw"
	
    For the action you can choose to pass the following parameters:

        All, Owner, Requestor, AdminCc, Cc

	NotifySMSgw implements netGSM protocol from HW-Group https://www.hw-group.com/product-version/netgsm

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL

        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.4 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::NotifySMS');
			
	For the SMS Gw notifications add configuration options 
	Set($SMSgwAPIURL,  qw(http://10.1.2.3/service.xml) );
	Set($SMSgwAccount, qw/username/);
	Set($SMSgwPaswd, qw/passwd/);

        You will also need to set other config values depending on which sms
        action is being used, see the module for specifications.
